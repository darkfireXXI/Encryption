# Encryption
Original Encryption and Decryption Algorithm

## Logic
Thanks to a previous project I now have a big .txt of prime numbers. Using these we can convert plain text to ASCII numbers and then manipulate them to encrypt our data. The operation itself is rather simple but produces messages that are large and hopefully sufficienctly hard to crack.  
  
The message can be read from a .txt or input in the terminal to encrypt. The encrypted output will then be printed to the Terminal and saved as a .txt. The file saved can then be decrypted using the Decryption Function.  
  
The Encryption Function takes the input text and converts it to ASCII.
